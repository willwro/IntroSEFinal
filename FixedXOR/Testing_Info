To test the code with a test suite:

1. Put both FixedXOR_Code.cpp and FixedXOR_Test.cpp into the same directory
2. Set up testing environment with testing suite of choice (GoogleTest with Bazel was used to test)
3. Test through Command Prompt using the test suite commands

Only one test case needed to be tested, and the test is carried out to completion, ensuring that the reulting XOR sequence is the required sequence.
